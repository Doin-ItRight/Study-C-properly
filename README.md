# Study-C-properly
 In order to study C# properly, I made a repository for testing.
 Of course, it is difficult to develop skills in a short period of time, but I think it is possible to make something the size of a book.
 If not... we'll have to do it until we can. The first goal is "C# to stimulate the brain", although the title of the book is strange.

 Let's do it right!!
